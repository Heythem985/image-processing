# 🧠 OpenCV Basics – Computer Vision with Python

This repository contains a collection of **OpenCV basics** — each Python file demonstrates a core image processing concept using simple, well-commented examples.  
Perfect for beginners who want to **learn and experiment with computer vision** step by step.

---

## 📘 Overview

The goal of this repository is to help you understand the **fundamental operations in OpenCV** such as:
- Reading and displaying images
- Changing color spaces
- Drawing shapes and text
- Applying filters (blurring, edge detection)
- Working with videos and webcams
- Performing object detection using contours

Each concept is implemented in a **separate Python file** for clarity and easy testing.
